          I have loved writing code for almost my entire life. When I was a kid,
          I used to make webpages from scratch and later started making my own
          games. The webpages and games were absolutely terrible, but I found
          the process of building software to be incredibly fulfilling and
          engaging.
          <br />
          I've dabbled in a dozen or so languages since then, from C++ to
          JavaScript to
          <Link href="https://ksp-kos.github.io/KOS/" isExternal>
            an obscure scripting language for the video game "Kerbal Space
            Program",
            <Icon as={RiExternalLinkLine} mr={2} />
          </Link>
          but I've since committed to learning modern web development
          technologies. I've immersed myself in this ever-growing niche and I'm
          constantly expanding my knowlege and skills as the industry grows and
          innovates.
